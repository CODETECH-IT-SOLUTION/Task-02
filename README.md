## Overview of the Project

TITLE: Library Management System

DESCRIPTION:
This Python script creates a Library Management System using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to manage library items, including adding new items, checking them out, returning them, and searching for items based on various keywords. The system tracks the status of each item, such as whether it is checked out, and calculates fines for overdue items.

CONCLUSION:
This Library Management System script demonstrates a practical application of object-oriented programming and GUI development using Tkinter. It provides an intuitive interface for managing library items, supporting essential operations like adding, checking out, returning, and searching for items. The script is a useful project for beginners looking to deepen their understanding of Python programming and GUI design.
